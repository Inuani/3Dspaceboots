# Real Assets Virtually Extended (RAVE Assets)

 A RAVE asset is a Real Asset Virtually Extended through a canister smart contract. This allows for a seamless digital extension of physical items.  This is a new concept for associating real-world items with their digital twins using canister smart contracts on the Internet Computer (ICP).

This repository provides an example of a RAVE asset with a 3D model of space boots, demonstrating how a physical item can be represented and managed digitally.

These boots are real, and this repo is an example of the representation of these boots on ICP.

## Example Project

You can view the canister that represent the boots [here](https://5a3r2-iyaaa-aaaas-aabaa-cai.icp0.io/).

## The Untapped Potential of ICP

ICP, or Internet Computer, offers a unique approach to building decentralized applications through its canister smart contracts. These canisters function as mini servers or computers and are incredibly cost-effective to create.. This low cost unlocks vast potential for innovative applications.

One particularly exciting use case is the ability to connect a canister to a real-world asset, effectively creating a digital twin.
