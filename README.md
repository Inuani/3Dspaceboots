# RAVE Assets: Real Asset Virtually Extended

This repository is an example of a RAVE asset, showcasing a pair of 3D space boots. RAVE stands for Real Asset Virtually Extended, which is a new concept for associating real-world items with their digital twins using canister smart contracts on the Internet Computer (ICP).

## The Untapped Potential of ICP

ICP, or Internet Computer, offers a unique approach to building decentralized applications through its canister smart contracts. These canisters function as mini servers or computers and are incredibly cost-effective to create, with a cost of approximately 50 cents per canister. This low cost unlocks vast potential for innovative applications.

One particularly exciting use case is the ability to connect a canister to a real-world asset, effectively creating a digital twin. This digital representation can be used for various purposes, such as tracking, management, and interaction with the physical item.

## RAVE Assets

In this project, we introduce the concept of RAVE assets. A RAVE asset is a Real Asset Virtually Extended through a canister smart contract. This allows for a seamless digital extension of physical items.

This repository provides an example of a RAVE asset with a 3D model of space boots, demonstrating how a physical item can be represented and managed digitally.
